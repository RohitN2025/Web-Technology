HTML allows viewing any page any time by clicking link.
The markup is the instructions for displaying or printing the text. Set of annotations or text is used to give instruction.
Tags are used to give instruction to browser about how to render a text.

// Introduction to HTML Document
The HTML tags are non-case sensitive
Tags are in < and > symbols
2 types of tags : 1) Paired Tags 2) Unpaired tags
In Paired Tags the text is placed between the tag and its companion tag
First tag --> opening tag

Paired tags are also called as Container tags

An unpaired tag is called as Singular or Stand-Alone Tags or emppty tags
